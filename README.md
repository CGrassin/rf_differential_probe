# RF Passive Differential Probe

This passive RF differential probe is a cost-effective solution for in-circuit measurements of RF systems operating within the frequency range of 500 MHz to 6 GHz. It is well-suited for situations where a test port is unavailable and it is engineered to have minimal impact on the device under test.

The probe's spring-loaded pins can be positioned at any angle to fit the ground-signal track spacing, with a practical lower bound of 1 mm, equivalent to the length of an 0402 component.

Compared to commercial active probes, this probe is significantly more affordable and has a different input power range, making it suitable for use on high-power RF circuits for instance.

A typical application for this probe is for tuning multiple-stage RF power amplifiers.
